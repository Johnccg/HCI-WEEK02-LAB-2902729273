                    Jakarta covers 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi), the smallest among any Indonesian provinces. However, its
                    metropolitan
                    area covers 6,392 km2 (2,468 sq mi), which extends into the two bordering provinces of West Java and
                    Banten. The
                    Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor
                    Regency)
                    and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).

                    Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta
                    Bay,
                    an inlet
                    of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is
                    plain land,
                    some areas of which are below sea level, and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the
                    city are
                    hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with
                    East
                    Timor's
                    Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23 km2 (255 sq mi) of land area
                    and
                    6,977 km2
                    (2,694 sq mi) of sea area. The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are
                    located
                    in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.

                    Jakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from −2 to 91 m (−7 to 299 ft) with an
                    average
                    elevation
                    of 8 m (26 ft) above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city have
                    been
                    constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area. Thirteen rivers flow through
                    Jakarta.
                    They are
                    Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West
                    Tarum,
                    Cakung,
                    Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the
                    city,
                    then
                    across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the
                    western
                    and
                    eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to
                    clogging,
                    make Jakarta prone to flooding.

                    Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) each year, and up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in
                    the
                    northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is
                    under
                    construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped
                    with a
                    pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The
                    project
                    is
                    expected to be completed by 2025. In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams
                    in
                    Ciawi,
                    Bogor and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the
                    city.
                    Nowadays, a 1.2 km (0.75 mi), with capacity 60 m3 (2,100 cu ft) per second, underground water tunnel
                    between
                    Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows. In
                    2023, the
                    New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30 cm) annually.

                    Environmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of groundwater, much
                    of it
                    illegal. Furthermore, the government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many
                    recently
                    built
                    high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting
                    groundwater. In
                    fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers
                    and
                    shopping
                    malls, 56 buildings had a groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally. This could be
                    halted by
                    stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other
                    sources
                    for water
                    use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has proven
                    to
                    help
                    cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue. The rivers of Jakarta are
                    highly
                    polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.

                    Jakarta faces significant air pollution, particularly during the dry season from August to December.
                    Dry
                    air
                    during this period allows pollutants to remain suspended in the atmosphere for extended periods,
                    contributing to
                    poor air quality.
