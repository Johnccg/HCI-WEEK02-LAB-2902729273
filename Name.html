                <p>Sundapura is the name mentioned in the Tugu inscription from Tarumanagara, a kingdom in coastal West
                    Java.
                    The strategic geographical position of coastal West Java, which corresponds to today modern Jakarta,
                    is a
                    commanding region that controls the Sunda Strait.
                    This location is strategic in regard to Sumatra and also its connection to Asian continent of India
                    and China.

                    After the fall of the Tarumanagara, the name of city was changed to 'Sunda Kelapa' or 'Coconut of
                    Sunda,'
                    growing to be the main harbour for the Sunda Kingdom due to its desirable location.

                    The name 'Jakarta' is derived from the word Jayakarta (Devanagari: जयकर्त), which is ultimately
                    derived from the
                    Sanskrit जय jaya (victorious), and कृत krta (accomplished, acquired), thus Jayakarta translates as
                    'victorious deed', 'complete act', or 'complete victory'. It was named for the Muslim troops of
                    Fatahillah which
                    successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527, eventually renaming it
                    'Jayakarta.' Tomé Pires, a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in his magnum opus as
                    Jacatra
                    or Jacarta during his journey to the East Indies.

                    After the Dutch East India Company took over the area in 1619, they renamed it 'Batavia', after the
                    Batavi, a
                    Germanic tribe who were seen as the ancestors of the Dutch. The city was then also known as Koningin
                    van het
                    Oosten (Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's
                    canals, mansions
                    and ordered city layout.[22] After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to
                    be more
                    associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide
                    lanes, green
                    spaces and villas.

                    During the Japanese occupation, the city was renamed as Jakaruta Tokubetsu-shi (ジャカルタ特別市; Jakarta
                    Special City).
                    After the Japanese surrender, the name was changed to 'Jakarta'.
