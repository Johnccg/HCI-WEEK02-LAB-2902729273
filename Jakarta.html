                    Jakarta, officially the Specific Region of Jakarta and formerly known as Batavia until 1949, is the
                    capital and
                    largest city of Indonesia and an autonomous region at the provincial level.
                    Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest
                    metropole in
                    Southeast Asia and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN.
                    The Specific Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is bordered by the province of
                    West Java
                    to the south and east and Banten to the west.
                    Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the
                    west.
                    Jakarta's metropolitan area is ASEAN's second largest economy after Singapore.
                    In 2023, the city's GDP PPP was estimated at US$724.010 billion.

                    Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political center of Indonesia.
                    Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23 km2 and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian
                    province, its
                    metropolitan area covers 7,076.31 km2, which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok,
                    Tangerang, South
                    Tangerang, and Bekasi,
                    and has an estimated population of 32.6 million as of 2022,making it the largest urban area in
                    Indonesia and the
                    second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).
                    Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index. Jakarta's
                    business and
                    employment opportunities,
                    along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of
                    the country,
                    have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous
                    cultures.

                    Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia.
                    Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the
                    Sunda
                    Kingdom.
                    At one time, it was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia.
                    Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a
                    province
                    with special capital region distinction.
                    As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency.
                    Jakarta is an alpha world city and the ASEAN secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the
                    Bank of
                    Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and
                    multinational corporations are located in the city.
                    Jakarta, as Indonesia's largest Muslim-majority city, is known for its tradition of religious
                    tolerance and
                    pluralism. The Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, stands as a symbol of the city's
                    commitment to
                    interfaith harmony.

                    Jakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, air pollution,
                    gridlocked traffic,
                    congestion, and flooding due to subsidence and water extraction.
                    Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively
                    safe. This has
                    made the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in
                    the world.
                    In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced plans to move the
                    capital from
                    Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of
                    Borneo.
                    The MPR approved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta
                    after
                    announcing plans to move the country's capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend US$40
                    billion,
                    which is more than the cost to build Nusantara, to save the city in the next decade.
